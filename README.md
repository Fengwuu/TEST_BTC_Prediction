## BTC_Predictiom

## Description

This is my first neural network training program. 
The program predicts the bitcoin exchange rate for tomorrow. 
The data is always up-to-date, thanks to the request for information at each start.
No one guarantees the accuracy of the data! In the event that you have lost money due to the use of predictions, I am not responsible.

## Future updates
- This application will definitely be reworked in the future, since there are only basic things in machine learning, as I develop this application will develop
